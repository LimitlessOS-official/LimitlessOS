# Real Binary And Real Hardware Gate

Effective after M21, new Product progress must be proven with real externally built software or real hardware behavior, not synthetic test processes.

Current status: the first static Linux x86_64 ELF execution gate, the M22 per-process page table foundation gate, the M23 bounded fork/wait gate, the M24 Unix pipeline gate, and the M25 Linux VFS path execution gate are crossed on the UEFI Product path. The verified commands are `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX echo limitless-real-binary`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX cat /proc/meminfo`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX cat /nvme/apps/data/file.txt`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX ls /nvme/apps`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX ls -l /proc/self/exe`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX ls -l /proc/self/fd`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX ls -l /proc/self`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'echo m22-cr3-isolation'`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'ls /nvme/apps; ls /nvme/apps/data'`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'echo hello | cat'`, `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'busybox echo m25-path-search'`, and `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'ls /usr/bin'`, using externally built BusyBox 1.35.0 static musl ET_EXEC binaries staged on the NVMe FAT image at `/APPS/BUSYBOX`.

Current BIOS budget note: the Product BIOS path has 101 reserve sectors, below the 128-sector warning threshold but still inside the hard 1024-sector loader limit. New real-binary work must continue to protect the BIOS path from accidental large buffers or code growth.

## Rule

A future milestone cannot be accepted as application execution, browser readiness, network readiness, storage readiness, or daily-driver progress if its only evidence is a synthetic process, a repo-built fixture, proof-only telemetry, or hardcoded status text.

Existing scaffold, denial, fixture, and repo-built app checks may remain as regression tests for safety boundaries. They must be labeled as foundation or regression evidence, not as proof that a user-facing capability works.

## What Counts

A real-binary execution claim requires all of the following:

- The executable is an unmodified binary built outside this repository by a normal third-party toolchain, distribution package, or upstream release.
- The binary is loaded from a user-visible path such as `/APPS`, `/HOME/bin`, mounted FAT storage, ISO media, or removable media.
- The loader, process setup, syscall path, filesystem path, and terminal output path are the same paths a user would use interactively.
- The binary's output, exit status, and failure modes are visible through the Product shell or GUI.
- Evidence records provenance: source package or URL, version, SHA-256, `file`/`readelf`/`objdump` metadata when available, the exact LimitlessOS path, the command run, and the observed output.

## First Execution Target

The first acceptable app-execution milestone is a static Linux x86_64 ELF from outside the repo. A static BusyBox is the accepted first target because it avoids the dynamic linker while still proving a real ELF loader, real process setup, real syscalls, real filesystem access, and real terminal output.

The current proof is recorded by `tools\verify-real-binary-gate.ps1`, direct `tools\verify-qemu.ps1 -RealBinaryGate` runs, and `build\real-binary-gate-provenance.txt` when the provenance verifier is used. It records provenance, SHA-256, file/readelf metadata, `/APPS/BUSYBOX`, the echo command and visible output, the `/proc/meminfo` cat command and visible output, the `/nvme/apps/data/file.txt` cat command and visible NVMe FAT fixture output, the `/nvme/apps` directory listing output, the `sh` banner and `$` prompt, the M22 CR3 isolation echo command, the M23 fork/wait shell external-command output, the M24 `echo hello | cat` pipeline output, the M25 BusyBox PATH-search command, the M25 `/usr/bin` fixed applet directory listing, exit codes, positive `drs-realbin` telemetry, NVMe VFS bind/release/read/readdir telemetry, Linux VFS BusyBox alias telemetry, terminal-size ioctl telemetry, cwd/chdir telemetry, relative path canonicalization telemetry, proc symlink telemetry, mixed `/proc/self` directory telemetry, pipe/fork/wait/execve telemetry, and negative coverage for missing file, dynamic `PT_INTERP`, low-address ET_EXEC binaries, oversized input, and BIOS unavailable behavior. The low-address negative uses a real upstream-default-address BusyBox when available and proves that ET_EXEC loads below `0x01000000` remain denied while the kernel still protects the low compatibility window. CI or release verification can require that proof explicitly with `-RequireLowAddressNegative`; the verifier rejects that switch if negative tests are skipped. The `-RequireShellCwdLoop` mode proves BusyBox ash current-working-directory behavior through `/`, `/nvme/apps`, and back to `/`. The `-RequireRelativePathProof` mode proves relative `.` and `..` canonicalization with `cat nvme/apps/./data/../data/file.txt` and `ls -l nvme/apps/./data/..`. The `-RequireProcSymlinkProof` mode proves `readlink(2)` through BusyBox `ls -l /proc/self/exe`. The `-RequireProcFdProof` mode proves stable proc-fd symlink enumeration for brokered fds 0, 1, and 2 through BusyBox `ls -l /proc/self/fd`; the bounded VFS intentionally skips the directory iterator fd for that directory so the verifier does not publish a link that can disappear before BusyBox's later `readlink` pass. The `-RequireProcSelfProof` mode proves mixed `/proc/self` directory enumeration for regular pseudo-files, the `fd` directory, and the `exe` symlink through BusyBox `ls -l /proc/self`. The historical `-TraceShellForkBoundary` mode records the BusyBox ash external-command boundary that M23 implemented. The NVMe file proof uses `/APPS/DATA/FILE.TXT` through the Linux-visible `/nvme/apps/data/file.txt` path because the older `/NVME.TXT` fixture is intentionally mutated by the broker-private `drs-nvme-fat` write checkpoint before the shell runs.

- `external\build\busybox-1.35.0-x86_64-linux-musl-0x52000000-standalone-sh`: BusyBox 1.35.0 static musl ET_EXEC linked at `0x52000000`, configured with `echo`, `cat`, `ls`, `true`, `sh`, `FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS`, `FEATURE_SH_STANDALONE`, `FEATURE_SH_NOFORK`, and a gate-local `cat` NOEXEC applet patch, SHA-256 `15ACD328B182BB8CA23133AFA36DD9BB0ECBD607E551EBFE2F7E13DB3A8283F2`, verified with the default real-binary gate including `echo`, `cat`, `ls`, the bounded `sh` builtin loop, the M22 CR3 isolation command, the M23 fork/wait external-command shell path, the M24 pipeline path, the M25 PATH-search command, and the M25 Linux-visible `/usr/bin` applet directory.

Proven syscall surface for those artifacts:

- Linux process startup: `brk`, `mmap`, `mprotect`, `munmap`, `arch_prctl`, `set_tid_address`, `rt_sigaction`, and `rt_sigprocmask`.
- Console and file I/O: `read`, `write`, `readv`, `writev`, `openat`, and `close`; `open`, `openat`, stat-family paths, and `chdir` now canonicalize relative paths against the Linux persona cwd before VFS resolution.
- Metadata: `stat`, `newfstatat`, including `AT_EMPTY_PATH`, and `lstat`.
- Proc symlink readback: `readlink`, with passing `/proc/self/exe` telemetry `readlink 1 readlink-bytes 14 readlink-denial 0 readlink-fault 0 readlink-last-result 14`, visible output `lrwxrwxrwx    1        14 /proc/self/exe -> /proc/self/exe`, and `unimplemented 0`; passing `/proc/self/fd` telemetry `getdents64 2 getdents64-entries 3 getdents64-bytes 72 stat 4 stat-denial 0 stat-fault 0 readlink 3 readlink-bytes 33 readlink-denial 0 readlink-fault 0 readlink-last-result 11`, with visible links for `0 -> anon:[fd 0]`, `1 -> anon:[fd 1]`, and `2 -> anon:[fd 2]`; and passing mixed `/proc/self` telemetry `getdents64 2 getdents64-entries 6 getdents64-bytes 168 stat 7 stat-denial 0 stat-fault 0 readlink 1 readlink-bytes 14 readlink-denial 0 readlink-fault 0 readlink-last-result 14 writev 6 writev-bytes 209`, with visible entries for `environ`, `cmdline`, `status`, `fd`, `exe -> /proc/self/exe`, and `maps`.
- Directory enumeration: `getdents64`, with passing telemetry `getdents64 2 getdents64-entries 2 getdents64-bytes 56`, and visible output `busybox` plus `data`.
- Current working directory: `getcwd` and `chdir`, with passing shell-loop telemetry `getcwd 1 getcwd-bytes 2 getcwd-denial 0 getcwd-fault 0 chdir 2 fchdir 0 chdir-denial 0 chdir-fault 0`, and visible output `/`, `/nvme/apps`, and `/`.
- Relative path canonicalization: `cat nvme/apps/./data/../data/file.txt`, with passing telemetry `path-relative 1 path-dot 1 path-dotdot 1 path-fault 0`, visible output `Nested FAT32 path fixture`, and NVMe VFS telemetry `vfs-nvme-reads 2 vfs-nvme-bytes 27`; plus `ls -l nvme/apps/./data/..`, with passing telemetry `console-bytes 65`, `getdents64 2 getdents64-entries 2 getdents64-bytes 56`, `stat 3 stat-denial 0 stat-fault 0`, `path-relative 4 path-dot 4 path-dotdot 4 path-fault 0`, `writev 2 writev-bytes 65`, `ioctl 1 ioctl-tty 1`, `vfs-nvme-readdirs 4 vfs-nvme-dirents 2`, and visible long-listing output `-r--r--r--    1    145264 busybox` plus `dr-xr-xr-x    2         0 data`.
- Terminal queries: `ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ)` for brokered terminal fds, with fixed 25x80 `winsize` telemetry `ioctl-tty`.
- Identity shims proven by BusyBox `sh`: `geteuid` returns fixed uid `1000`, and `getppid` returns fixed ppid `1`.
- Process-name shim proven by standalone-shell BusyBox: `prctl(PR_GET_NAME)` and `prctl(PR_SET_NAME)` maintain the 16-byte Linux comm field used by BusyBox applet dispatch; other `prctl` options remain `ENOSYS`.
- Process creation and reaping: bounded `fork(57)` full-copies the current Linux persona process root, lower-half VMA/address-space mappings, FD table, persona state, VFS state, and audit state for the observed BusyBox ash external-command and pipeline paths; the child returns 0, the parent receives the child pid, blocking `wait4(61)` reaps the child exit status, and all PML4 slots are returned to the static pool. Broad `clone` flags, `vfork`, COW, threading, and signal delivery remain outside this gate.
- Pipes: `pipe(22)` creates brokered read/write fd pairs backed by the existing fixed pipe pool, and fork preserves exact pipe fd numbers in children. `PIPE64_MAX_OBJECTS` remains 16 and `PIPE64_BUFFER_BYTES` remains 4096. `pipe2(293)` behavior is unchanged.
- Exec and path aliases: `execve` can load a real static ET_EXEC binary through the Linux VFS path resolver using a UEFI-only 2 MiB staging buffer and a 64 KiB real-exec user stack; the older synthetic 4 KiB exec stack constants remain reserved for regression tests. Read-only BusyBox applet aliases under `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, and `/usr/sbin` resolve to the staged NVMe FAT `/APPS/BUSYBOX` binary through the Linux-visible `/nvme/apps/busybox` backend path. `/usr` exposes fixed `bin` and `sbin` entries. Dynamic linking, broad interpreter lookup, and arbitrary distro `/bin` population remain outside this gate.
- Exit: `exit_group`.

Current shell proof: `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh` prints the BusyBox ash banner and a `$` prompt through brokered console output, consumes a bounded brokered-stdin mini loop `echo shellloop`, `true`, `echo aftertrue`, then exits 0. Passing telemetry includes `console-bytes 90`, `read 40`, `read-bytes 40`, `write 2`, `write-bytes 20`, `writev 6`, `writev-bytes 70`, `ioctl 3`, `ioctl-tty 3`, `ioctl-enotty 0`, `ioctl-enosys 0`, `prctl 2`, `prctl-set-name 1`, `prctl-get-name 1`, `prctl-enosys 0`, and `unimplemented 0`. Standalone `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX ls /nvme/apps` separately proves visible directory entries `busybox  data` with `getdents64 2`, `getdents64-entries 2`, `getdents64-bytes 56`, `vfs-nvme-readdirs 4`, and `vfs-nvme-dirents 2`.

Current cwd shell proof: `tools\verify-real-binary-gate.ps1 -RequireShellCwdLoop` runs BusyBox ash builtins `pwd`, `cd /nvme/apps`, `pwd`, `cd /`, and `pwd` in the brokered stdin loop. Passing telemetry includes `console-bytes 101`, `exit 0`, `cleanup 1`, `getcwd 1`, `getcwd-bytes 2`, `getcwd-denial 0`, `getcwd-fault 0`, `chdir 2`, `fchdir 0`, `chdir-denial 0`, `chdir-fault 0`, `fork 0`, and `unimplemented 0`.

## M22 Per-Process Page Table Gate

M22 is accepted on the UEFI Product path with `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'echo m22-cr3-isolation'`. The command uses the externally built BusyBox 1.35.0 static musl ET_EXEC standalone-shell artifact staged from NVMe FAT at `/APPS/BUSYBOX`, prints `m22-cr3-isolation`, exits 0, and proves the Linux persona runs on a process-owned PML4 instead of the kernel root.

The static pool design is fixed-size and UEFI-only: 4 process roots, 19 pages per root, 4 x 19 x 4096 = 311,296 bytes for PML4/PDPT/PD/PT tables. Each process root has private lower-half user/VMA tables and copied shared higher-half kernel/MMIO mappings. CR3 switches happen at scheduler task start/swap/exit boundaries; there is intentionally no syscall-entry CR3 switch because each process root already shares the higher-half kernel mapping needed by syscall entry and brokered kernel work.

The transitional low identity compatibility mapping remains present and must stay visible as `low-compat 1` in every M22 gate run until the low-window compatibility path is removed. This means M22 proves process-owned roots, private lower-half user/VMA page tables, shared kernel/MMIO mappings, and correct scheduler CR3 switching; it does not yet claim final isolation below the low compatibility window.

M22 final artifact budget: UEFI reserve moved from 852,544 bytes at the first successful pool-stage build to 848,416 bytes at final acceptance. BIOS reserve held at 101 sectors, below the 128-sector warning threshold but still inside the hard 1024-sector loader limit.

## M23 Fork/Wait Gate

M23 is accepted on the UEFI Product path with `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'ls /nvme/apps; ls /nvme/apps/data'`. This is the previously traced BusyBox ash external-command boundary: BusyBox issues syscall `57` at `fork-last-rip 0x000000005200EF74`, the parent receives a child pid, the child runs the command under a distinct PML4 slot, `wait4(61)` collects exit code 0, and both parent and child process roots are cleaned up.

Visible console output:

M23 implementation delta: 19 kernel/header files changed with 2,112 insertions and 33 deletions; the prerequisite QMP keyboard semicolon injector changed 1 verifier line, for 20 total changed files with 2,113 insertions and 33 deletions. Final reserves are UEFI 840,160 bytes and BIOS 101 sectors.

## M24 Pipe Gate

M24 is accepted on the UEFI Product path with `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'echo hello | cat'`. BusyBox ash forks both pipeline sides, so the correct proof shape is `fork 2 fork-success 2` and `fd-fork-pipe-copy 3`: the producer and consumer children both inherit pipe-related state, the producer writes `hello\n`, the consumer reads and writes it to the brokered console, and the parent reaps both children.

Visible console output:

```text
hello
```

M24 implementation scope: Linux `pipe(22)` ABI exposure over the existing fixed pipe provider, exact-fd pipe endpoint inheritance in `fd64_fork_process`, `pipe64_grant_endpoint_at` for fork semantics, QMP `|` keyboard injection, and real-binary telemetry for pipe calls, pipe denials/faults, live pipe count, pipe provider denials, and fd fork pipe copies. `pipe2(293)` observable behavior remains unchanged. `PIPE64_MAX_OBJECTS` remains 16 and `PIPE64_BUFFER_BYTES` remains 4096.

Final reserves are UEFI 836,064 bytes and BIOS 101 sectors. The passing artifact is `external\build\busybox-1.35.0-x86_64-linux-musl-0x52000000-standalone-sh`, SHA-256 `15ACD328B182BB8CA23133AFA36DD9BB0ECBD607E551EBFE2F7E13DB3A8283F2`, static musl ET_EXEC linked at `0x52000000`.

## M25 Linux VFS Path Execution Gate

M25 is accepted on the UEFI Product path with `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'busybox echo m25-path-search'` and `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'ls /usr/bin'`. The first command proves BusyBox ash PATH search can find a Linux-visible executable alias backed by the real staged NVMe BusyBox binary, load it with `execve`, transfer control to the new static ET_EXEC image, and return with exit status 0. The second command proves `/usr/bin` is a directory in the Linux VFS with stable applet entries and no stat denials.

Visible `/usr/bin` console output:

```text
sh       true     ls       cat      echo     busybox
```

M25 implementation scope: UEFI-only real-binary `execve` widening over the Linux VFS, a 64 KiB real-exec stack for real external ET_EXEC images, consume-once syscall return-frame transfer to the new ELF entry/RSP, release and cleanup handoff for exec-replaced persona state, read-only BusyBox aliases under `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, and `/usr/sbin`, fixed `/usr` directory entries, and `vfs-bin-*` plus `execve-*` telemetry. It does not add dynamic linking, glibc support, vfork, broad clone flags, threading, signal delivery, sockets, broad ioctl/device control, or arbitrary host-package filesystem population.

Final reserves are UEFI 831,968 bytes and BIOS 101 sectors. The passing artifact is `external\build\busybox-1.35.0-x86_64-linux-musl-0x52000000-standalone-sh`, SHA-256 `15ACD328B182BB8CA23133AFA36DD9BB0ECBD607E551EBFE2F7E13DB3A8283F2`, static musl ET_EXEC linked at `0x52000000`. The final implementation delta before docs is 8 files changed with 751 insertions and 34 deletions.

M25 path-search proof summary: `linux /APPS/BUSYBOX sh -c 'busybox echo m25-path-search'` prints `m25-path-search`, exits 0, reports `execve 1 execve-denial 0 execve-fault 0 execve-last-binary-bytes 145264 execve-last-transfer-ready 1 vfs-bin-alias 3 vfs-bin-read 1 vfs-bin-denial 0 stat-denial 0 page-faults 0 syscall-root-repair 0 pml4-pool-used-final 0`.

Proposed M26 scope: `execve across forked external children`. M26 should force BusyBox ash to fork and exec Linux-visible external applet paths in child processes, then prove the child exec image inherits stdin/stdout/stderr, pipe endpoints, cwd, and NVMe VFS authority correctly through fork, exec, wait, and cleanup. This should remain narrower than dynamic linking, glibc, vfork, real threading, signal delivery, sockets, broad clone flag compatibility, or broad ioctl/device control.

Later targets are:

- dynamic Linux ELF with `PT_INTERP`, relocations, libc, environment, and filesystem semantics
- Windows PE console executable with real import resolution and process parameters
- Mach-O executable with a real loader path, only after the Linux and Windows paths have stopped being scaffolds

## Hardware And Daily-Driver Order

The daily-driver path is gated by real hardware:

- Terminal reliability first: the QEMU verifier now has a real BusyBox `sh` banner/prompt proof through brokered console output and bounded brokered stdin; hardware-terminal and GUI-focus behavior still need physical-device evidence before broader daily-driver claims.
- Network next: wired Ethernet should be attempted before Intel AX1675 Wi-Fi because Wi-Fi requires firmware loading, regulatory handling, scan/auth/association, key management, and a full 802.11 data path.
- Persistent storage next: make the NVMe namespace readable through a user-visible filesystem path, then add safe writes only to an explicitly approved LimitlessOS target.
- External binary execution: the UEFI Product path now runs a real third-party static ELF from user-visible NVMe storage; next external-binary work should deepen process semantics rather than count synthetic or fixture binaries as Product progress.
- Browser last: a browser needs network, persistent storage, a C runtime, dynamic linking, threads, timers, memory mapping, filesystem semantics, certificates, fonts, graphics, input, and real process isolation.

## Non-Claims

The following do not count as future Product capability acceptance by themselves:

- embedded ELF byte arrays
- repo-assembled flat binaries
- synthetic Linux/Windows/Mach-O process records
- syscall stubs that are not exercised by an external binary
- denial-only MMIO or storage chains
- status panels with no underlying driver or runtime behavior
- QEMU-only success when the claim is about the MSI laptop's hardware
